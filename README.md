In recent years, the field of autonomous vehicles has made significant strides, creating advancements in **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **sensor technologies**, and **deep learning** to redefine transportation. As part of UCSD’s [ECE/MAE148 (Introduction to Autonomous Vehicles)](https://ucsd-ecemae-148.github.io/) course, our team worked on the development of **SonicCar**, a state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle capable of responding to **voice commands** and navigating its environment intelligently and safely.

The SonicCar system integrates several innovative technologies to achieve its functionality. It uses **speech-to-text recognition** to convert spoken commands into actionable text, which is then processed by a **large language model (LLM)** to interpret and execute the instructions. This unique approach allows SonicCar to understand complex and natural language commands, providing a seamless user experience.

To ensure safety and compliance with road rules, SonicCar incorporates both **Li-DAR-based obstacle detection** and a **camera-based stop sign recognition system**. The obstacle detection module enables the vehicle to detect and brake for objects in its path, while the stop sign recognition module, trained using **RoboFlow deep learning**, ensures adherence to traffic regulations. Together, these systems enhance the vehicle's reliability and situational awareness in dynamic environments.

The project represents a synthesis of voice control, AI-based natural language processing, and autonomous vehicle navigation, offering an accessible and interactive user interface while prioritizing safety. SonicCar showcases the potential for integrating **human-machine interaction technologies** with autonomous systems, paving the way for innovative applications in modern transportation.

The mechanical design of SonicCar focused on creating custom components to support the functionality of the vehicle. These components were designed, prototyped, and fabricated to ensure flexibility, durability, and compatibility with the onboard systems. Key mechanical elements include:  

- **Platform:**  
  - Designed and laser-cut a **custom platform** mounted on top of the car’s base to hold critical components such as the Jetson Nano, camera, Li-DAR, and GPS.
  - The platform uses **multiple parallel slots** to allow flexibility in the positioning and installation of components.
  - It also has four pins that connect it to the car body. They are simple, sturdy and very flexible (for example, we simply adjusted the length and reprinted the feet when we needed to raise the platform).

## Programming
### Overview
The chart below shows how the software is structured. Fundamentally, we are using ROS2, especially to provide communication (the blue boxes in the chart represent ROS2 nodes). A high-level overview over the components:
- **Publisher**: Runs on a laptop, uses the laptop's microphone to turn voice commands into text (speech-to-text), then uses a Large Language Model to understand the intent of the text and translates it into commands for the car steering angle, throttle and the timeout (how long a command should be executed until it stops). It then publishes these commands to the `steering_commands` topics. This is also where the graphical user interface runs.
- **Subscriber**: Runs on the Jetson Nano, listens to incoming commands on the `steering_commands` topic and publishes them to the VESC node via the `/cmd_vel` topic. Also tracks the Li-DAR to prevent collisions with appearing objects and uses the OAK-D camera to detect stop signs.
- **VESC node**: Prewritten node from DonkeyCar, tranlates commands on the `/cmd_vel` topic to electronic signals to the servo motor (for steering) and DC motor (for throttle).
- **Li-DAR node**: Prewritten node from DonkeyCar, publishes Li-DAR measurements to the `/scan` topic.
- **FastDDS discovery server**: Running on the Jetson, used to enable communication between devices (laptop and Jetson). All ROS2 nodes register with the discovery server so they are discoverable to all other nodes.
- **OAK-D Camera**: Directly connected to the Jetson via USB, runs the stop sign detection AI model.

</div>




### Speech-to-Text (STT)
For understanding voice commands, we leverage the microphone of the laptop so the user does not have to move along the Jetson Nano. We use the Python package `SpeechRecognition` and concretely, the underlying Google Speech Recognition API, to get the command spoken as text. We typically saw latencies of 400-600 ms, depending on the network connection. Note that the `SpeechRecognition` uses a hardcoded API key for the API and there is a limit on the number of requests you can do per day.

The code listens for 4 seconds (by default) and then sends off anything recorded to the API.

### Understanding Intent with an LLM
After handling speech-to-text, the next task is to extract three variables to direct the car how to maneuver: Direction (angle), speed (ranging from 0 to 1), and the amount of time to do such actions. To gain maximum flexibility with how commands can be expressed (and not to be just limited to certain, pre-coded keywords), we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM), in this case Google's Gemini-1.5-Flash. The LLM is instructured with a system prompt containing three sections:
- General instructions on which three values to extract and which values are allowed
- A range of example sentences and answers
- Definition of how to format the output (in our case, we want a JSON format which we can easily parse afterwards).

The API key for the Gemini API has to be set as an environment variable (see step-by-step instructions below). You can request your own key [here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). The Gemini API was chosen because it offers a very easy interface and a generous free plan. With the LLM in place, our system can interpret even more complex driving instructions like "make a u-turn" or "go a little more to the right while being way faster". The LLM parses each command and converts it into structured data that we use to steer the car. After we receive the output of the LLM, we do some processing and case handling to ensure that the right parameters are published to the `steering_commands` topic.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The GUI is consists of a button, a status text box, a timeout dountdown text box and an emergency stop button. To interact with it, the user clicks the Start Recording button. After talking, the audio is transcribed and intent understood (as described above). The understood intent is then shown on the user interface (in the status text box). In case there are any errors, they are also shown in the GUI. After the command was sent to the Jetson, a countdown starts indicating how much longer the command will be executed on the Jetson. The emergency stop button works at all times to immediately publish a stop signal (zero velocity) to the `steering_commands` topic.

Behind the scenes, the GUI leverages the Python `tkinter` package and is launched from the ROS2 publisher node and keeps running continuously. It is in the `graphical_user_interface.py` script and called the `VoiceRecorderUI`.

### Communication with ROS2
Because our ROS2 nodes had to communicate across devices (laptop and Jetson), we had some unique challenges with making the nodes talk to each other. In theory, ROS2 should automatically discover all nodes running on the same WiFi network. Unfortunately, this did not work for us. We found a workaround by setting up out own [FastDDS discovery server](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.14.3/fastdds/discovery/discovery_server.html). We have this server running at port `11888` on the Jetson in a separate terminal window. Then, on the laptop and all terminals where we run ROS2 nodes, we set an environment variable for the discovery server IP and port: `export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="[YOUR-IP]:[YOUR-PORT]"` (on the Windows command line, this is `set ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER=[YOUR-IP]:[YOUR-PORT]`). If this variable is set, ROS2 (more specifically FastDDS) automatically uses the server to discover nodes.

One interesting issue we had: Instead of the IP address (which changes regularly), we wanted to use the Jetson's fixed hostname, `ucsdrobocar-148-12`. However, this resulted in errors since IPv4 hostnames apparently [can only include one dash](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/what-is-a-valid-hostname). To save time, we did not investigate this further, though there is likely a workaround. Instead, we regularly run `hostname -I` on the Jetson to see the current IP address.

### Command Processing & Actuation
This is running in the subscriber node, which is executed on the Jetson. The commands received on the `steering_commands` topic consist of three values: Steering angle (-1 to 1), throttle (0 to 1) and timeout (any number of seconds). They are processed using the `command_callback()` function, which essentially just writes the values to the `/cmd_vel` topic, which the VESC node listens to. A timed method (`keep_moving()`) ensures the car continues moving until a timeout occurs or a new command is received.

### Li-DAR-based Collision Avoidance
The Li-DAR-based collision avoidance system utilizes the Li-DAR scanner and ROS2 to detect obstacles and shut the car down it they get too close. Below is a detailed breakdown of the components and their roles:
- **Li-DAR Node**: Included in the UCSD-DonkeyCar packages, this package publishes Li-DAR measurements to the `/scan` topic.
- **Subscriber Node**: This node subscribes to the `steering_commands` topic to receive motion commands and to the `/scan` topic for Li-DAR data.
Li-DAR data is filtered to only the front third of the vehicle's field of view. Then, the minimum distance to nearby objects is calculated. If the minimum detected distance is less than the configured threshold (by default `(0.4 meters)`), the car is stopped immediately to avoid a collision. This logic is encapsulated in the `lidar_callback()` method.

### Stop Sign Detection
Roboflow streamlines the process of building a robust stop sign detection model by facilitating data collection, labeling, training, and deployment. The dataset used for this project was sourced from Roboflow, which contained 453 labeled stop sign images. These diverse images simulate varied real-world conditions, improving the model's ability to generalize across different environments. The original plan with this was to integrate Roboflow as a secondary emergency stop feature. However, we ran into issues as the way we retrieve results from OAK-D gives faulty values for distance. This is no big deal as originally, we planned on Sonic to stop one meter away from the stop sign but the minimum it can stop was 3 meters. 

Training results were evaluated using key metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), which measures precision across all classes, ensuring balanced performance. Precision reflects how often the model's predictions are correct, while recall indicates the percentage of relevant labels successfully identified by the model. These metrics highlight the model's effectiveness and help fine-tune its performance.

The trained model was deployed to the OAK-D camera using the Python package roboflowOAK. The deployment runs via the subscriber node running on the Jetson, to which the camera is connected via USB. This integration enables real-time stop sign detection directly on the OAK-D. A confidence threshold of 90% ensures reliable detections, minimizing false positives while maintaining responsiveness. The reason it was bumped to 90% instead of 80% was because it kept viewing other people as stop signs. The combination of Roboflow's robust tools and the OAK-D's hardware efficiency delivers an optimized solution for stop sign detection.

## How to Run (step-by-step)
Anytime there is a variable here, remove the square brackets as well.

### On the Jetson:

0. Make sure the Jetson is turned on. Wait until the fan starts spinning (pretty good indication on when it has connected to the Wi-Fi. Make sure your laptop is also connected to the `UCSDRoboCar` network. Then, SSH into the Jetson: `ssh jetson@ucsdrobocar-148-[TEAM-NR].local`
1. Get the UCSD DonkeyCar docker image: `docker pull djnighti/ucsd_robocar:devel`
2. Start Docker container: `docker start [CONTAINER-NAME]`
3. Execute bash on container `docker exec -it [CONTAINER-NAME] bash`
4. Source ROS2: `source_ros2`
5. The first time, navigate to the `src` folder and clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/dglttr/MAE148FinalProject.git`. Afterwards, remember to `git pull` and rebuild the package before using it to have the latest changes (`colcon build --merge-install --packages-select listening_bot`).
6. Source ROS2 package: `. /install/setup.bash`
7. Check the current IP address of the Jetson (needed for discovery server later): `hostname -I`
8. Launch FastDDS discovery server: `fastdds discovery --server-id 0 --port 11888`
9. Now, open another terminal and repeat steps 0, 3, 4 and 6 - this will be used to launch the VESC and Li-DAR nodes
10. Set environment variable for FastDDS server: `export ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER="[IP-ADDRESS]:11888"`
12. Stop ROS2 daemon to make sure the discovery server will be used: `ros2 daemon stop`
13. Launch Li-DAR and VESC nodes with launchfile: `ros2 launch listening_bot listening_bot.launch.py`
14. Now, open another terminal and repeat steps 0, 3, 4, 6 and 10 - this will be used to launch the subscriber node (we do this in a separate terminal so the terminal is not flooded with messages from the VESC and Li-DAR nodes)
15. Set Roboflow environment variable to get the stop sign detection model: `export ROBOFLOW_API_KEY="[YOUR-ROBOFLOW-API-KEY]"`
16. Run subscriber: `ros2 run listening_bot subscriber`

### On PC/Laptop (Windows):

0. First, you will need to install ROS2. We used ROS2 Foxy. Newer ROS2 versions may work, but we did not test that. Here are the [install instructions for Windows](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html).
1. The first time, clone the listening_bot repository into a folder of your choosing: `git clone https://github.com/dglttr/MAE148FinalProject.git`. Afterwards, navigate to that folder: `cd [PATH-TO-FOLDER]`.
2. `git pull` to make sure you are on the newest version.
3. Build package: `colcon build --merge-install --packages-select listening_bot`
4. Source package. On Windows, it works like this: `call install/setup.bat` 
5. Set environment variable for FastDDS server: `set ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER=[JETSON-IP-ADDRESS]:11888`
6. `ros2 daemon stop`
7. Set the LLM_API_KEY: `set LLM_API_KEY=[API-KEY]`. You can get the API key for the Google Gemini API [here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
8. Run the publisher: `ros2 run publisher`
